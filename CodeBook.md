Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freqBodyAcc-XYZ, freqBodyAccJerk-XYZ, freqBodyGyro-XYZ, freqBodyAccJerkMag, freqBodyGyroMag, freqBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value  
std(): Standard deviation  
mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array  
min(): Smallest value in array  
sma(): Signal magnitude area  
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.  
iqr(): Interquartile range  
entropy(): Signal entropy  
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals  
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal  
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal  
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.  
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean  
timeBodyAccMean  
timeBodyAccJerkMean  
timeBodyGyroMean  
timeBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

Each feature was recorded for 30 subjects, each performing 6 different activities:

WALKING  
WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
SITTING  
STANDING  
LAYING.

Data Cleaning Process
=====================
1) The training and test data sets were combined into one data set.
2) Only the mean and standard deviation measurements for each feature were extracted.
3) Activity and descriptive variable names were applied.
4) A separate tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
